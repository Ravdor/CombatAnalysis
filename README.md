While a stats bar's info is locked, the "always hide" visibility option will be overriden. (More info about this will be added to the instructions above soon.)

- Changing the order of, or moving tabs between windows, while the tab area is filled will scroll along to make the outcome of the performed action more obvious.
- You can now see which bar is being hovered over when the bar length is zero, and the window background is set to transparent.
- The stats panel now correctly updates when new data causes the bar ordering to change while the mouse is hovering over the bars (during combat).
